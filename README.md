# ausf

AUSF is an important service function in the 5G Core network. It provides the
basic authentication for both 3gpp and non-3gpp access. Crucial for secured
network access, the AUSF is responsible for the security procedure for SIM
authentication using the 5G-AKA authentication method. AUSF connects and also
provides services with UDM (Unified Data Management) and AMF (Access and
Mobility Management Function) through SBI.

AMF requests the authentication of the UE by providing UE related information
and the serving network name and the 5G AKA is selected. The NF Service Consumer
(AMF) shall then return to the AUSF the result received from the UE.

## Supported Features

1. Supports Nudm_UEAuthentication Services Procedure
2. Nausf_UEAuthentication (Authentication and Key Agreement)
3. Provides service on SBI interface Nausf
